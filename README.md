## About
A Java console-based Library Management System that supports Admin and Regular User roles. Admins can add, edit, and delete books, and register users. Regular users can browse the catalog, borrow available books, and return them. The app uses OOP principles, generics, and collections, and persists data using Hibernate and MySQL.
